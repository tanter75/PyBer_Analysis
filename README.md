# Overview of the analysis:  

The purpose of this analysis is to tabulate the weekly fares results for Pyber ride-sharing data and compare the information based on city type. 

 
## Results:  
The analysis of the Pyber ride-sharing data shows us that the Urban location fares ($39.854.38) totaled more than Rural and Suburban fares combined ($23,684.26), although the average fare per ride was lower for Urban cities ($24.52) as compared to Suburban ($30.97) or Rural ($34.62) locations.  The total drivers also varied greatly between Urban (2,405), Suburban (490) and Rural (78).  The largest disparity in results was in Average Fare per Driver.  For Urban cities the amount was $16.57, for Suburban $39.50 and for Rural $55.49. 

 
## Summary: 
The analysis of the Pyber ride-sharing data shows that there is a difference in average fares, average fare per driver and total fare based on city type.  There may be several contributing factors that have not been considered in this analysis, such as average distance per fare, number of vehicles per household and availability of alternate forms of transportation (such as public transit, taxis, bicycles, etc.).  These differences may have considerable impact on the results of fares by city type.  

The analysis of the report did make the following findings: 

1.	Rural centers had the fewest available drivers, the highest average fare per ride and highest average fare per driver. 
2.	Suburban centers and the second highest results with regards to: available drivers, average fare per ride and average fare per driver. 
3.  Urban centers had the most available drivers, lowest average fare per ride and lowest average fare per driver. 

 
## Conclusion and Recommendations: 

Although differences are noted with regards to fares based on city type, it is recommended that an analysis be completed on comparable cities to determine any variations in fares.  It would be reasonable to expect that fares in rural areas would be for longer distances than fares in urban cities.   

 
### Recommendations: 
1.  Focus on providing additional services in urban centers where the need for ride-sharing programs is greatest as is fare revenue. 
2.  Increase number of drivers in suburban settings where ratio of drivers to rides is 1.28 - this is underserviced when compared to the urban driver to rides ratio is 0.67. 
3.  Increase number of drivers in rural areas where ratio of drivers to rides is 1.60. 
4.  Run analysis on comparable urban centers to ensure there is sufficient coverage of drivers available and allow for accurate cost comparisons based on length of trip.
